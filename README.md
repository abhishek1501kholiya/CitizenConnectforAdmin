# 🛠️ Citizen Connect For Admins  
This is the admin version of the citizen connect repository (which is basically facebook but for people living in the same neighborhood).    
# 💬 Description  
This version is for moderating the citizen connect app to make sure people are not posting any content which is against the terms of use.  
# 🧑‍💻 Tech Stack  
Just like the main app I have used react native with firebase in the backend.    
# 📲 Usage  
To use this app you can clone the repository and run the following commands -  
Step 1:  
Open the path to the project in the terminal and run the following command - 
```  
npm install  
```  
this command will install all the dependencies and packages required to run the app    
  
Step 2:  
```
expo start   
```
this command will start the development server and after the development server has started you can test it on the web, mobile or simulator  
  
*for web*  
type **w** and it will open a new tab to show you the app  
*for mobile*  
to run this on mobile you would have to install the **expo** app on app store or play store and then scan the qr code on the terimanl  
*for simulator*  
type **i** to run it on a simulator  

Note: make sure you use the same firebase credentials you used in the [citizen connect](https://github.com/abhishek1501kholiya/Citizen) so they share the same database.  

Thank you for taking the time to check out this repo  
Keep coding
